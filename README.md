# OpenStack vagrant setup

## What

This is a simple way to quickly get a working OpenStack setup for testing or playing.

It provides the basic components split in the following nodes:

   * puppet: the required modules and manifests for the setup
   * controller: keystone, glance, nova
   * compute1: nova-compute

## TODO

   * get the nodes configured using puppet
